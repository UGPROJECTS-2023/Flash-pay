To download a Node.js project from GitHub and start the server, follow these steps:
For a React project, the process is quite similar to a generic Node.js project, with a few additional steps specific to React. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Clone the Repository:
   Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project. Use the following command to clone the frontend repository:

   ```bash
git clone -b master  https://github.com/UGPROJECTS-2023/VICTOR_YAKUBU_MUSA--FCP-CSC-18-1034.git
   ```


2. Navigate to the Project Directory:
   Change your working directory to the newly cloned project:

   ```bash
   cd repository
   ```

   Replace `repository` with the actual name of the project directory.

3. Install Dependencies:
   In a React project, you typically use `npm` to install dependencies. Run one of the following commands:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```


4. Start the Development Server:
   React projects often include a development server to facilitate local development. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   or


   This will start the development server, and you can access your React application in a web browser at `http://localhost:3000` by default.
6. Access the React App:
   Open a web browser and go to the specified address (usually `http://localhost:3000` unless configured differently).

Setup for backend

1. Clone the Repository:
   Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project. Then use the following command to clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone  https://github.com/UGPROJECTS-2023/VICTOR_YAKUBU_MUSA--FCP-CSC-18-1034.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the Project Directory:
   Change your working directory to the newly cloned project:
   ```bash
   cd repository
   ```
   Replace `repository` with the actual name of the project directory.

3. Install Dependencies:
   In most Node.js projects, you need to install the dependencies specified in the `package.json` file. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This will download and install the necessary Node.js modules.

4. Start the Server:
   Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the Node.js server. Look for an entry point file, often named `index.js` or `app.js`. Use the following command:
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

   If the project uses a tool like `nodemon` for development, you might want to use that for automatic server restarting during development:
   ```bash
   nodemon index.js
   ```
   Make sure to install `nodemon` globally if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   npm install -g nodemon
   ```
5. Access the Server.
   Once the server is running, open a web browser and go to the specified address. The default address is often `http://localhost:3001`.
